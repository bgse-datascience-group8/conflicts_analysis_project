      h1 Data Summary
      p Here, we examine the raw data in order to understand its endogenous characteristics.
      p For more on the original dataset creation, see   
        a(href='https://github.com/bgse-datascience-group8/conflicts_analysis_project/blob/master/documentation/database.md') the database documentation in our github repo.

      p#subselection The subset of events from the GDELT database were defined in the following ways:
      ul
        li Events occurring between July 2013 and November 6, 2015.
        li Inititally this set included 2,018 distinct cities having 1,507,041 events.
        li This initial set was subset to 100 cities with the greatest number of days with data. 82% of conflicts are represented by these top 100 cities (script: 
            a(href='https://github.com/bgse-datascience-group8/conflicts_analysis_project/blob/master/scripts/sql/top_cities.sql') top_cities.sql).

      h2#standardization Raw vs Log vs Standardized Data
      p It is reasonable to assume (and mentioned by GDELT documentation) the number of events in aggregate or in any given city is growing over time.
      p Below, find visual comparisons of the raw number of conflict events per city, its log transformation, and the number of events standardized by date (z-score). In the second set of plots, a smoothing function is applied to ascertain trends in the noisy data.
      p One thing stands out: Washington D.C. is a systematic outlier being the most conflicted city by a factor of 6 times the second highest conflicted city. At first, these plots suggest the time trend was negligible and the log transformation could be used in later analysis. However the assumption that the data was mostly stationary for our time period was contradicted in auto-correlation analysis. So for the remainder, the analysis utilizes the standardized number of conflicts.
      p We also found a weekend effect and a population effect; these

        li Washington D.C. has a different mean, we will include a dummy isWashingtonDC.
        li Data is stationary over the time period, we don't need to standardize or difference the data with respect to time. Log number of conflicts is the dependent variable.
        li Weekend has a negative effect, we will include a weekend dummy.
        li Population has a positive and non-linear effect. We will include the quadratic term for log population.
